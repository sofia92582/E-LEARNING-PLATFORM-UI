DOMAIN:FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

DURATION:8 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH
DESCRIPTION
In this task, the goal is to design the front-end of an e-learning platform using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript or any front-end framework (like React.js or Vue.js). This project focuses only on the user interface (UI) — meaning how the platform looks and how users interact with it — not the backend or database.

The platform should include key features commonly seen in online learning websites, such as:

Course Listing Page – A section where users can see all available courses. Each course should show a title, short description, image, and a button to start or view more details.

Progress Tracking – Show progress bars or indicators to reflect how much of a course has been completed by the user (this can be a static visual only, no need for real data tracking).

Video Embedding – A page where course content can be displayed using an embedded video player (like YouTube or HTML5 video).

You can also add extra sections like a homepage, about page, contact form, or user login (only UI, not functional). Focus on clean design, easy navigation, and responsiveness — meaning the website should look good on phones, tablets, and desktops.

This task helps you practice front-end development by designing a multi-page, interactive, and professional-looking educational site. It’s important to use good layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. You can use tools like Google Fonts and CSS Flexbox/Grid to make your layout better.

Deliverable:
Submit a responsive, styled front-end design of the e-learning platform. Make sure it's well-organized and uploaded to GitHub. Comment your code where needed for better understanding.
